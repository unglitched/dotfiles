# These are aliases for tools managed with Docker.
# I started using docker recently for certain apps for a few reasons:
#   1. Reduce attack surface.
#   2. Debian runs behind on some security tooling, this helps stay up to date.
#   3. Reduce dependency hell
#
# Unfortunately this means: Docker images will eat a lot of space, they start slower, and if a maintainer removes a container I'm SOL. 
# As such I'm keeping a fairly high bar here. Only docker images updated by the maintainer are allowed.
